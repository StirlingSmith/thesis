abstract = {Recently, the advent of deep learning has spurred interest in the development of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in a parametric setting. Among all different classes of deep neural networks, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has attracted increasing attention in the scientific machine learning community, since the parameter-sharing feature in CNN enables efficient learning for problems with large-scale spatiotemporal fields. However, one of the biggest challenges is that CNN only can handle regular geometries with image-like format (i.e., rectangular domains with uniform grids). In this paper, we propose a novel physics-constrained CNN learning architecture, aiming to learn solutions of parametric PDEs on irregular domains without any labeled data. In order to leverage powerful classic CNN backbones, elliptic coordinate mapping is introduced to enable coordinate transforms between the irregular physical domain and regular reference domain. The proposed method has been assessed by solving a number of steady-state PDEs on irregular domains, including heat equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and Poisson equations with parameterized boundary conditions, varying geometries, and spatially-varying source fields. Moreover, the proposed method has also been compared against the state-of-the-art PINN with fully-connected neural network (FC-NN) formulation. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and exhibit notable superiority over the FC-NN based PINN in terms of efficiency and accuracy.}

	abstract = {Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on Dec 31, 2019 (CHP 2020), the disease has spread worldwide and met with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected (Li et al. 2020a; Wu \&amp; Leung 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Chinazzi et al. 2020; Ferguson et al. 2020; Kraemer et al. 2020). Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting (Li et al. 2020b). In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24th till March 3rd window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1st. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis effort was partially funded by the Intelligence Advanced Reseach Projects Activity (IARPA.)Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology–from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids–can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via e-mail, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks. The study of temporal networks is very interdisciplinary in nature. Reflecting this, even the object of study has many names—temporal graphs, evolving graphs, time-varying graphs, time-aggregated graphs, time-stamped graphs, dynamic networks, dynamic graphs, dynamical graphs, and so on. This review covers different fields where temporal graphs are considered, but does not attempt to unify related terminology—rather, we want to make papers readable across disciplines.}

  abstract = {Threshold models try to explain the consequences of social influence like the spread of fads and opinions. Along with models of epidemics, they constitute a major theoretical framework of social spreading processes. In threshold models on static networks, an individual changes her state if a certain fraction of her neighbors has done the same. When there are strong correlations in the temporal aspects of contact patterns, it is useful to represent the system as a temporal network. In such a system, not only contacts but also the time of the contacts are represented explicitly. In many cases, bursty temporal patterns slow down disease spreading. However, as we will see, this is not a universal truth for threshold models. In this work we propose an extension of Watts’s classic threshold model to temporal networks. We do this by assuming that an agent is influenced by contacts which lie a certain time into the past. I.e., the individuals are affected by contacts within a time window. In addition to thresholds in the fraction of contacts, we also investigate the number of contacts within the time window as a basis for influence. To elucidate the model’s behavior, we run the model on real and randomized empirical contact datasets.}
